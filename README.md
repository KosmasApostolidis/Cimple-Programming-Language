# Cimple Description
Cimple is a small, educational programming language. It resembles the C language, from which it draws ideas and structures, but is significantly smaller in both supported structures and programming capabilities. 
The name Cimple comes from the C language and the word implementation, while sounding like the word simple, to emphasize its simplicity. 
Although its programming capabilities are limited, this educational language contains rich features, and the construction of its compiler presents considerable interest, as it includes many commands used by popular languages, as well as some original ones. Cimple supports structures like while and if-else, but also the original and interesting in implementation forcase and incase. It also supports functions and procedures, parameter passing by reference and value, recursive calls. It allows nesting in the declaration of functions, which few languages support (Pascal supports it, C does not). On the other hand, Cimple does not support basic programming tools, such as the for loop, or data types like real numbers, strings, or arrays.
