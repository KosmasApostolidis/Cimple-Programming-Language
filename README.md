# Cimple-Programming-Language
This repository is created for the Compilers Course (**ΜΥΥ802**) at the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Ioannina (UOI)**

## Overview
Cimple is a small, educational programming language designed to introduce programming concepts with simplicity. Inspired by C, it focuses on fundamental programming structures and capabilities, tailored for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Syntax and Structure**: Resembles **C**, offering a familiar ground with simpler constructs.
- **Educational Focus**: Ideal for teaching basic programming concepts such as loops (while, forcase, incase), conditional statements (if-else), and functions.
- **Unique Elements**: Introduces original constructs like forcase and incase for educational exploration.
- **Functionality**: Supports functions, procedures, parameter passing by reference and value, and recursive calls.
- **Limitations**: Excludes complex data types and structures like real numbers, strings, and arrays for simplicity.

## Getting Started
- Cimple files use the **.ci** extension.
